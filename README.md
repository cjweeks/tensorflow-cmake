Integrate TensorFlow with CMake projects effortlessly.

## TensorFlow
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an amazing tool for machine learning and intelligence using computational graphs.
TensorFlow includes APIs for both Python and C++, although the C++ API is slightly less documented. However, the most standard
way to integrate C++ projects with TensorFlow is to build the project *inside* the TensorFlow repository, yielding a massive binary.
Additionally, [Bazel](http://www.bazel.io/) is the only certified way to build such projects. This document and the code in this
repository will allow one to integrate TensorFlow with CMake projects without producing a large binary.

Note: The instructions here correspond to an Ubuntu Linux environment; although some commands may differ for other operating systems and distributions, the general ideas are identical.

## Step 1: Install TensorFlow
Follow the [instructions](http://www.bazel.io/docs/install.html) for installing Bazel.  Install dependencies and clone
TensorFlow from its git repository:
```bash
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip  # Protobuf Dependencies
sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev python-wheel      # TensorFlow Dependencies
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow                  # TensorFlow
```
Enter the cloned repository, and append the following to the `tensorflow/BUILD` file:
```bash
# Added build rule
cc_binary(
    name = "libtensorflow_all.so",
    linkshared = 1,
    linkopts = ["-Wl,--version-script=tensorflow/tf_version_script.lds"], # if use Mac remove this line
    deps = [
        "//tensorflow/cc:cc_ops",
        "//tensorflow/core:framework_internal",
        "//tensorflow/core:tensorflow",
    ],
)
```
This specifies a new build rule, producing `libtensorflow_all.so`, that includes all the required dependencies for integration
with a C++ project. Build the shared library and copy it to `/usr/local/lib` as follows:
```bash
./configure      # Note that this requires user input
bazel build tensorflow:libtensorflow_all.so
sudo cp bazel-bin/tensorflow/libtensorflow_all.so /usr/local/lib
```
Copy the source to `/usr/local/include/google` and remove unneeded items:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow
sudo cp -r tensorflow /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/
sudo find /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow -type f  ! -name "*.h" -delete
```
Copy all generated files from bazel-genfiles:
```bash
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/core/framework/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/core/kernels/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/core/lib/core/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/lib/core
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/core/protobuf/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/protobuf
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/core/util/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/util
sudo cp bazel-genfiles/tensorflow/cc/ops/*.h  /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops
```
Copy the third party directory:
```bash
sudo cp -r third_party /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/
sudo rm -r /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/third_party/py

# Note: newer versions of TensorFlow do not have the following directory
sudo rm -r /usr/local/include/google/tensorflow/third_party/avro
```


## Step 2: Install Eigen and Protobuf
The TensorFlow runtime library requires both [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
However, specific versions are required, and these may clash with currently installed versions of either software. Therefore, two options are
provided:

- Install the packages to a directory on your computer, which will overwrite / clash with any previous versions installed in that directory (but allow multiple projects to reference them).
The default directory is `/usr/local`, but any may be specified to avoid clashing. *This is the recommended option.*
- Add the packages as external dependencies, allowing CMake to download and build them inside the project directory, not affecting any current versions.  This will never result in clashing,
but the build process of your project may be lengthened.

Choose the option that best fits your needs; you may mix these options as well, installing one to `/usr/local`, while keeping the other confined in the current project. In the following 
instructions, be sure to replace `<EXECUTABLE_NAME>` with the name of your executable. Additionally, all generated CMake files should generally be placed in your CMake modules directory, 
which is commonly `<PROJECT_ROOT>/cmake/Modules`.

### Eigen: Installing Locally
Execute the `eigen.sh` script as follows: `sudo ./eigen.sh install <tensorflow-source-dir> [<install-dir> <download-dir>]`. The `install` command specifies that Eigen is to be installed to 
a directory. The `<tensorflow-source-dir>` argument should be the root of the TensorFlow repository. The optional `<install-dir>` argument allows you to specify the installation directory;
this defaults to `/usr/local` but may be changed to avoid other versions. The `<download-dir>` argument specifies the directory where Eigen will be download and extracted; this defaults
to the current directory.  

To generate the needed CMake files for your project, execute the script as follows: `./eigen.sh generate installed <tensorflow-source-dir> [<cmake-dir> <install-dir>]`. The `generate` command specifies that the 
required CMake files are to be generated and placed in `<cmake-dir>` (this defaults to the current directory, but generally should your CMake modules directory). The optional `<install-dir>`
argument specifies the directory Protobuf is installed to. This defaults to `/usr/local` and should directly correspond to the install directory specified when installing above. Two files
will be copied to the specified directory: `FindEigen.cmake` and `Eigen_VERSION.cmake`. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
# Eigen
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

### Eigen: Adding as External Dependency
Execute the `eigen.sh` script as follows: `./eigen.sh generate external <tensorflow-source-dir> [<cmake-dir>]`. The `external` command specifies that Eigen is not
installed, but rather should be treated as an external CMake dependency. The `<tensorflow-source-dir>` argument again should be the root directory of the TensorFlow repository,
and the optional `<cmake-dir>` argument is the location to copy the required CMake modules to (defaults to the current directory). Two files will be copied
to the specified directory: `Eigen.cmake` and `Eigen_VERSION.cmake`. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
# Eigen
include(Eigen)
add_dependencies(<EXECUTABLE_NAME> Eigen)
```


### Protobuf: Installing Locally
Execute the `protobuf.sh` script as follows: `sudo ./protobuf.sh install <tensorflow-source-dir> [<install-dir> <download-dir>]`.  The arguments are identical to those described in the Eigen
section above.  

Generate the required files as follows: `./protobuf.sh generate installed <tensorflow-source-dir> [<cmake-dir> <install-dir>]`; the arguments are also identical to those above. 
Two files will be copied to the specified directory: `FindProtobuf.cmake` and `Protobuf_VERSION.cmake`. CMake provides us with a `FindProtobuf.cmake`
module, but we will use our own, since we must specify the directory Protobuf was installed to. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
# Protobuf
find_package(Protobuf REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Protobuf_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(<EXECUTABLE_NAME> ${Protobuf_LIBRARIES})
```

### Protobuf: Adding as External Dependency
Execute the `protobuf.sh` script as follows: `./protobuf.sh generate external <tensorflow-source-dir> [<cmake-dir>]`. The arguments are also identical to those described in the Eigen
section above. Two files will be copied to the specified directory: `Protobuf.cmake` and `Protobuf_VERSION.cmake`. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
# Protobuf
include(Protobuf)
add_dependencies(<EXECUTABLE_NAME> Protobuf)
```

## Step 3: Configure the CMake Project

Edit your `CMakeLists.txt` to append your custom modules directory to the list of CMake modules (this is a common step in most CMake programs):
```CMake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH <CMAKE_MODULE_DIR>)
# Replace <CMAKE_MODULE_DIR> with your path
# The most common path is ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules
```
If *either* Protobuf or Eigen was added as an external dependency, add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
# set variables for external dependencies
set(EXTERNAL_DIR "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/external"
        CACHE PATH "Location where external dependencies will installed")
set(DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${EXTERNAL_DIR}/src"
        CACHE PATH "Location where external projects will be downloaded")
mark_as_advanced(EXTERNAL_DIR DOWNLOAD_LOCATION)
include_directories(${EXTERNAL_DIR}/include)
```

The projects in the `examples/` directory demonstrate the correct usage of these instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Compiler Path Build Error
If Bazel fails to build the TensorFlow library, stating `error: Could not find compiler "gcc" in PATH`, you may have to execute the following:
```bash
bazel clean                                   # Clean project
export CC="/usr/bin/gcc"                      # Set location of C compiler
export CXX="/usr/bin/g++"                     # Set location of C++ compiler
bazel build tensorflow:libtensorflow_all.so   # Rebuild project
```
